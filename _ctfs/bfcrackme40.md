Hey, and welcome to another adventure of one of my CrackMe´s  
The rules are similar (the same) as in the earlier realeses and those are:

1. No patching allowed (disassemblers are allow to get a overwiew, but no patching)

2. SoftIce is of course allowed and others similar debuggers like TRW2000...

3. When you succed (which shouldn´t take that long) send me the solution but with YOUR name and serial, so I know that you didn´t just rip the serial from a friend or anything...
Other kind of solutions are welcomed as are tutorials..The prize to the ten first people who makes it will be put in the next versions "Greet" section.

Now have a good time now and remember:  
"If there is a crack, make it a hole"
Probarly a little unclear for the most of the people but I think some of you know what the sentence meant?! ;)

Btw if you find any bugs please contact me as soon as you can so it can be fixed (I don´t have time for those kind of things, cuz you will find them for me). Those who finds a bug will also be in the next "Greet" section, so if you don´t make it don´t feel bad find a bug instead  :)

My e-mail is as usual:

boba303@hotmail.com or you can visit http://www.lockless.com/ and send a mail from there.


Thats all for know...

Looking forward to hear from anyone of you who reads this letter....

This is Boba Fett for Lockless Cracking Crew saying: "Good day"
